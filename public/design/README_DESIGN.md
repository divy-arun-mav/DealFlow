- Rounded shapes, subtle borders, generous whitespace.

Key screens implemented in code
- Navigation: simple top bar with primary routes.

- Onboarding (buyer/seller): step-based forms with distinct primary colors.
- Buyer Directory: glanceable cards with budget, industry, location, involvement, and accept/reject actions.
